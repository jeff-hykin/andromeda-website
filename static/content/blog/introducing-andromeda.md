We're thrilled to introduce **Andromeda**, a revolutionary JavaScript and
TypeScript runtime that's 100% written in Rust and powered by the
[Nova JavaScript engine](https://trynova.dev/).

## Why Another JavaScript Runtime?

The JavaScript ecosystem has seen tremendous growth over the years, but we felt
there was room for improvement in terms of:

- **Performance**: Leveraging Rust's zero-cost abstractions
- **Security**: Memory safety built-in from the ground up
- **Simplicity**: A clean, minimal API surface
- **Developer Experience**: Fast startup times and clear error messages and
  debugging capabilities
- **Compatibility**: Support for modern JavaScript and TypeScript features
- **Extensibility**: Easy to integrate with existing tools and libraries
- **Modularity**: Components that can be used independently or together

### Built on Nova Engine

Andromeda is powered by [Nova](https://trynova.dev/), a cutting-edge JavaScript
engine written in Rust that prioritizes:

- Memory safety without garbage collection overhead
- Compile-time optimizations
- Predictable performance characteristics

### Rust-First Architecture

Every component of Andromeda is written in Rust from the ground up, and this
allows for:

- **Memory Safety**: Elimination of common bugs such as null pointer
  dereferences
- **Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions and minimal runtime overhead
- **Interoperability**: Seamless integration with existing Rust libraries
- **Tooling**: Leverage the rich Rust ecosystem for testing, debugging, and more
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on any platform that supports Rust, including Linux,
  macOS, and Windows

Getting started is as easy as:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/tryandromeda/andromeda
```
